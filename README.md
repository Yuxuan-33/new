# Number Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple Python script that runs an interactive number guessing game.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You can optionally set the `SEED` environment variable to make the random
number deterministic for testing:

```bash
SEED=0 python3 main.py
```
